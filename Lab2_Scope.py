# Trace through the execution of the following program.
# Answer the questions in the comments with your group members.
# After discussing, use print statements to confirm your answers.

foo = 100
bar = foo
foo + bar

# POINT 1
# What is the value of foo at this point?
# print("200")
# What is the type of foo at this point?
# # Answer: Int
# What is the value of bar at this point?
# Answer: 100
# What is the type of bar at this point?
# Answer: Int

# 200 = spam
# foo = 150
# egg = 250
# bar = 100
# ham = [1, 2, 3, 100]
